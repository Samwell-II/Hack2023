To get things started,
1. In a terminal navigate to the backend/ directory and enter the venv using 
$source venv/bin/activate
If this is the first setup, then it will be necessary to setup this venv first, as well as install flask.
2. Now in the venv, run the command
$flask run
3. In a different terminal, navigate to frontend/ and run
$yarn run dev
4. Open the specified port in your browswer and everything *should* work.
